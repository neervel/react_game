# My first app with React

This project is my first app, which developed with React.js - game "Tic-Tac-Toe".

The basic version of game allows you: play "Tic-Tac-Toe" (with your friend, for example), and return to any step of your game.

## My future steps are:

- [x] Show postition of each step in history;
- [x] Show selected step in history;
- [ ] Rewrite component Board with cycle rendering instead of hard-coding;
- [ ] Add switch to sort hostory in  ASC or DESC;
- [ ] Highlight 3 winner's squares;
- [ ] Add status for draw end;
